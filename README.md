# **Object Removal**
 In this project our aim was to develop a model which takes an image as its input and extracts the objects from that image by removing its background.
## **Model**
As our model we have used the pretrained model DeepLabv3 which handles the problem of segmenting objects at multiple scales. In addition to that we have also taken the help of opencv in this project.
